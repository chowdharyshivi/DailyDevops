SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for establishing a secure, encrypted connection between two computers. 
It is primarily used for remote access and command-line management of servers and other computing systems.
 SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, such as the internet, allowing users to securely log 
 in to remote systems, execute commands, and transfer files.
